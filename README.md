Remote-Tank
===========

I wrote Tank as my Senior Seminar project for my BS in Computer Science at UVA-Wise. The hardware design requires a basic radio controlled vehicle, in my case a small tank. The radio transmitter send 4 command: forward, backward, left, right. The way the tank was designed, when the left/right buttons were pressed, only one of the tank tracks moved causing the tank to turn. This will be different for other types of automobiles.
